# 2022 Ohio Senate Elections Sentiment Analysis

The 2022 midterm elections are scheduled to be held tomorrow Nov 8th, and thought it was a good time to do a quick analysis to understand the public mood in Ohio and opinion towards the senate candidates.

For this analysis, I collected tweets since Jan 2022 using "Snscrape" to scrape tweets from Twitter, and performed sentiment classification using "Twitter-roBERTa-base" model, which was trained by Hugging Face.
